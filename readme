For sentence_transformer:

How does it work?
- Line 11 in itemrec.php calls transformer.py using shell command
- exec(command,$out,$ret) command behaves as "python3 transformer.py $chosen_test"

Issues needs to be aware
- 1. the command path may be various on machines
- 2. php exec authority is limited
- 3. to solve issue 2, sentence_transformer folder in python lib should be set as for everyone
- folder name: sentence_transformers/sentence_transformers_all-MiniLM-L6-v2
